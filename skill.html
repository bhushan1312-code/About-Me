    <p>Hi, I’m Bhushan, a final-year engineering student with strong technical skills in both frontend and backend development. I have hands-on experience in:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Backend: Java, Spring Boot

Database: SQL

Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub

I enjoy building full-stack projects, continuously learning new technologies, and solving real-world problems through code. I’m looking for opportunities where I can 
apply my skills, learn from industry experts, and grow as a full-stack Java developer. </p>
